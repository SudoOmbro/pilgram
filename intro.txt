Greetings stranger. Welcome to the grim & dark world of {wn}.

Test your strength and your gear by going on endless quests and become the ultimate adventurer.
Gain wealth ({mn}) and experience, join cults, meet friendly faces during your travels, acquire powerful gear & beautiful homes!

You can do all that & more in Pilgram, you just have to create a character with the `create character` command!

Then after that, use the `embark 1` command to begin your first quest!

Wait a day or two and you'll be notified if you managed to finish the quest. In the meantime you'll get updates on what your character is doing.

While you wait i highly suggest you check out the manual for the game. Bring it up with the `man 1` command.

Enjoy!

Use the `help` command to see all the commands you can use.

And thanks for playing :)
